      The Ram pickup (marketed as the Dodge Ram until 2010 when Ram Trucks was
      spun-off from Dodge) is a full-size pickup truck manufactured by
      Stellantis North America (formerly Chrysler Group LLC and FCA US LLC) and
      marketed from 2010 onwards under the Ram Trucks brand. The current
      fifth-generation Ram debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto
      Show in Detroit, Michigan, in January of that year.
