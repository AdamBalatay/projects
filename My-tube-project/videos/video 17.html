      Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916â€“1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate,
      founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with
      Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel
      drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales
      plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil
      crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a
      bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of
      Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco
      and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco
      and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed
      under the control of the group's Audi division.
