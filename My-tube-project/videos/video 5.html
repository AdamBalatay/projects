      The Subaru WRX is an all-wheel drive sport compact car manufactured by the
      Japanese automaker Subaru, originally based on the Impreza created for the
      World Rally Championship in 1992.[1] Subaru claimed the name WRX stands
      for "World Rally eXperimental". [2] Starting with the 2015 models, the WRX
      lineup has been split from the Impreza, with a different body style that
      is not offered as an optional hatchback/wagon, being introduced as the
      separate Levorg model.
