      The Nissan GT-R (Gran Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese:
      日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R) is a car built by Japanese marque Nissan since
      2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a sports car and
      a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four
      wheels. It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a faster variant of the
      Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the
      GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built
      on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and
      Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at
      Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.
