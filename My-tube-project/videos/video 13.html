      The Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car, which uses Audi's
      trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. It was introduced by
      the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006. Production ended in the first
      quarter of 2024. The car is exclusively designed, developed, and
      manufactured by Audi AG's private subsidiary company manufacturing high
      performance automotive parts, Audi Sport GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH), and
      is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo and presently the Hurac√°n platform.
      The fundamental construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame,
      and uses an aluminium monocoque which is built using space frame
      principles. The car is built by Audi Sport GmbH in a newly renovated
      factory at Audi's 'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany. At the time
      it was introduced in 2006, the R8 became the first production car with
      full-LED headlamps.
