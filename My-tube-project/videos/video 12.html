      The Raptor is a nameplate used by Ford for its high-performance pickup
      trucks and SUVs. In use since the 2010 model year, the Raptor is
      designated as the highest-performance version of the F-150, Ranger and
      Bronco. Drawing its name from both bird of prey and the velociraptor, the
      model line is intended as a street-legal counterpart of an off-road racing
      trophy truck. The F-150 Raptor is currently in its third generation; the
      Ranger Raptor was introduced in 2019 (in markets outside of North America)
      while the Bronco Raptor was released in late 2021.
