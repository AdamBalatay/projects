    <p>OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015 and headquartered in San Francisco, California. Its mission is to develop "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom, OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora.Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI<p/></article>

    <section id="types of open AI"> <h2 style="background: black; color: white">types of open AI</h2>
    <article> <ul>
        <li>text type</li>
        <li>video type</li>
        <li>picture type</li>
        <li>sound type</li></ul>
    <p>open AI is alway evolving and getting better when it first came out they werent great for example the picture type would put to many fingers on people and the video type were to blurry, there is also alot of controversy around if it okay to use it or not because it usese othere people voice or design</p>

    <h2 style="background: black; color: white">about the topic</h2>
    <article> <p>OpenAI’s large language models, including the models that power open AI, are developed using three primary sources of information: (1) information that is publicly available on the internet, (2) information that we license from third parties, and (3) information that our users or our human trainers provide.</p>

    <h2 style="background: black; color: white">text type-ChatGPT</h2> 
    <article> <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts, essays, code and emails.</p>

    <article> <p>DALL-E creates images based on user prompts "ideas" It matches words with pictures it's learned from, then adjusts colors iteratively to produce an image made from a canvas (noise). When the color values match, an entirely unique, if derivative, image is output to the user. This is similar (but much faster) to artists who create organically by manipulating colors to match their own references. The prompt establishes the reference point. The human artists themselves manipulate color differences with paint brushes, or a computer and a mouse. ALL-E is a Transformer model that creates images from textual descriptions.[210] DALL-E uses a 12-billion-parameter version of GPT-3 to interpret natural language inputs (such as "a green leather purse shaped like a pentagon" or "an isometric view of a sad capybara") and generate corresponding images. It can create images of realistic objects ("a stained-glass window with an image of a blue strawberry") as well as objects that do not exist in reality ("a cube with the texture of a porcupine"). As of March 2021, no API or code is available.</p>
